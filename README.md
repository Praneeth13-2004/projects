### the projects are 
  #### 1. emotion recognition
        The emotion recognition project contains the code in python to 
        recognize the facial expressions of a human.

        This project uses the packages such as 
        1. cv2 from opencv
           This can be used to take the input, display the output and 
           to write the output on output frame
        2. DeepFace from deepface
           The DeepFace package is a lightweight Python framework used
           for facial recognition and facial attribute analysis 
           (such as age, gender, emotion, and race estimation). 
           It simplifies complex computer vision tasks by wrapping several
           state-of-the-art deep learning models, allowing developers to
           implement these functionalities with minimal code.
